Asteroids made in Monogame 2.8 with revision of Panther engine.
This is the best clone I've made of the game yet.
Next feature coming is high score list, and having it saved to storage.
To play, Side Arrows control rotation. Up arrow thrust, down arrow hyperspace. Left CTRL or Space to fire. Enter to start.
